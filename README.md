## 🌿 About This Repository

This repository is a simple archive of my projects.  
Instead of storing source code here, I use this space to document and showcase my work.

Each project is presented with:
- A clickable title (link to the project)
- A short description of what the project is about

Think of this as my digital portfolio wall.
